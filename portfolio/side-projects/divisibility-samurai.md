# Divisibility Samurai - Flutter Web Game
https://divisibility-samurai.web.app/

## Project Overview

A complete Flutter web-based math educational game where players identify numbers divisible by given divisors. Features physics-based gameplay with numbers appearing as blocks that players "slash" to score points and progress through tiers and levels. Runs in web browsers on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Game Structure

### Content Design (36 Total Levels)
- **ðŸ“š Study Tier**: 9 levels, divisors 2-12, numbers 1-50 range
- **ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Tier**: 9 levels, divisors 2-12, numbers 10-99 (2-digit)
- **ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier**: 9 levels, divisors 2-12, numbers 100-999 (3-digit) 
- **ðŸ¥‡ Gold Tier**: 9 levels, divisors 2-12, numbers 1000-9999 (4-digit)

### Game Mechanics
- **Physics System**: Custom 2D physics with tier-based gravity and collision detection
- **Lives System**: 10 total lives, lose 1 for incorrect answers
- **Level Progression**: Complete 10 correct blocks per level to advance
- **Web-based**: Optimized for browser play on both mobile and desktop (360x480 viewport)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Platform**: Flutter/Dart for web development
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with GameViewModel and GameStateViewModel
- **Performance**: 60 FPS game loop with delta time calculations
- **Physics**: Custom 2D physics engine with Vector mathematics
- **State Management**: Comprehensive game state system (playing, paused, completed, etc.)

### Game Features
- **Audio System**: Tier-based background music and sound effects with volume controls
- **Analytics**: Player statistics tracking and level progression
- **Web Deployment**: Firebase hosting with automated build pipeline
- **User Experience**: Screenshot downloads, persistent settings, responsive design
