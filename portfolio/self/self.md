## My Story

My passion lies in everything patterned, especially Maths, Physics, and Computer Science. I have been sharing this passion through private tutoring for over 10 years, beginning during my first year of university.

Born in Hong Kong, I have been fascinated by maths and patterns since childhood. My dedication to studying paid off with excellent grades in Hong Kong's public exams. In the HKCEE (grade 11), I achieved As in Maths, Additional Maths, Chemistry, and Biology, and B's in Physics and Economics. In the HKALE (grade 13), I earned an A in Physics and a B in Pure Maths.

I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2015. The Math department there is renowned across Asia for its competitiveness and challenging undergraduate courses. My time there was truly the best of my life.

After graduation, I continued tutoring part-time while working as a Software Engineer.

In 2021, I moved to Vancouver to broaden my horizons and completed a Diploma in Computer Studies at Langara College. I achieved top marks in all my courses, earning the Langara President's Trust Scholarship, awarded to the student with the highest GPA in their program.

I currently work as a tutor at multiple tutoring centers and also offer private lessons in Vancouver.

## Teaching Style

My teaching approach centers around my love for STEM subjects. I believe that genuine enthusiasm can create an engaging learning environment. In my sessions, I encourage students to be curious, experiment, and embrace challenges. This approach helps develop the creative problem-solvers of tomorrow.

I also recognize the importance of practice in mastering any skill. Therefore, I offer customized learning materials tailored to each student's unique needs. This personalized approach enhances their STEM abilities, preparing them not just for current academic challenges but for future success in this rapidly evolving field.

My commitment to education is about more than sharing knowledge; it's about inspiring a lifelong journey of learning and discovery in the fascinating world of STEM.

## Motivations for investment firm
- Working in investment firm is a great experience and challenge to learn the real world system. To handle the data in real time and fast, to produce strong and robust system, are important skills that cannot be easily achieved.
- As a backend developer, it is always fulfilling when I can build a system that is robust and supportive. When I built the web backend for Gracious leader, the system originally has severe problems, but finally I fixed them all. This is satisfying.
