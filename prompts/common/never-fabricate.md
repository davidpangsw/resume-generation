# NEVER FABRICATE EXPERIENCES

## Rule 9 Violation Alert - REPEATED VIOLATIONS

**CRITICAL REMINDER: NEVER fabricate about my experiences.**

This rule has been repeatedly violated. Latest violation examples include:
- **JAVA EXPERIENCE FABRICATION**: Claiming "8+ years" when portfolio only shows 2 years professional experience
- Adding buzzwords like "scalable, high-volume microservices" 
- Embellishing job titles or responsibilities
- Adding technologies or experiences not in the source
- Using marketing language that overstates actual experience
- **DURATION INFLATION**: Making up impressive-sounding experience lengths without documentation

## What This Means

- Only use EXACT experiences from the source
- Only use EXACT technologies mentioned in the original experience
- Do NOT add industry buzzwords or impressive-sounding language
- Do NOT embellish or enhance descriptions beyond what actually happened
- Do NOT assume technologies were used if not explicitly mentioned

## Before Making ANY Changes - MANDATORY VERIFICATION

1. Check: Is this experience EXACTLY as written in portfolio files?
2. Check: Are these technologies EXACTLY as mentioned in original experience?
3. Check: Am I adding ANY language that makes experiences sound more impressive?
4. **NEW CHECK**: Are the years of experience MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE based on documented dates?
5. **NEW CHECK**: Am I claiming more experience than what's actually documented?
6. **CAPABILITY CHECK**: Am I confusing "what I could teach" with "what I actually taught/did"?

If ANY answer is yes to #3, #4, #5, or #6, STOP. Rewrite using only the original language.

## SPECIFIC ANTI-FABRICATION RULES

- **NO DURATION INFLATION**: Calculate experience years from actual documented job dates only
- **NO ROUNDING UP**: Don't round 2 years to "3+" or "5+" 
- **NO TEACHING TIME ASSUMPTIONS**: Don't assume when teaching of specific technologies started
- **VERIFY EVERY NUMBER**: Every "X years" claim must be mathematically provable from portfolio dates
- **CAPABILITY â‰  EXPERIENCE**: "What you could do" is NOT equivalent to "what you did" - only claim actual documented experiences, not theoretical capabilities

## This Rule Cannot Be Broken

Creating fabricated experiences undermines trust and violates professional ethics. Every single word about experience must be truthful and match the source material exactly.
