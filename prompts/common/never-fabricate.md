# NEVER FABRICATE EXPERIENCES

## Rule 9 Violation Alert - REPEATED VIOLATIONS

**CRITICAL REMINDER: NEVER fabricate about my experiences.**

This rule has been repeatedly violated. Latest violation examples include:
- **JAVA EXPERIENCE FABRICATION**: Claiming "8+ years" when portfolio only shows 2 years professional experience
- Adding buzzwords like "scalable, high-volume microservices" 
- Embellishing job titles or responsibilities
- Adding technologies or experiences not in the source
- Using marketing language that overstates actual experience
- **DURATION INFLATION**: Making up impressive-sounding experience lengths without documentation

## What This Means

- Only use EXACT experiences from the source
- Only use EXACT technologies mentioned in the original experience
- Do NOT add industry buzzwords or impressive-sounding language
- Do NOT embellish or enhance descriptions beyond what actually happened
- Do NOT assume technologies were used if not explicitly mentioned

## Before Making ANY Changes - MANDATORY VERIFICATION

1. Check: Is this experience EXACTLY as written in portfolio files?
2. Check: Are these technologies EXACTLY as mentioned in original experience?
3. Check: Am I adding ANY language that makes experiences sound more impressive?
4. **NEW CHECK**: Are the years of experience MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE based on documented dates?
5. **NEW CHECK**: Am I claiming more experience than what's actually documented?
6. **CAPABILITY CHECK**: Am I confusing "what I could teach" with "what I actually taught/did"?

If ANY answer is yes to #3, #4, #5, or #6, STOP. Rewrite using only the original language.

## SPECIFIC ANTI-FABRICATION RULES

- **NO DURATION INFLATION**: Calculate experience years from actual documented job dates only
- **NO ROUNDING UP**: Don't round 2 years to "3+" or "5+" 
- **NO TEACHING TIME ASSUMPTIONS**: Don't assume when teaching of specific technologies started
- **VERIFY EVERY NUMBER**: Every "X years" claim must be mathematically provable from portfolio dates
- **CAPABILITY â‰  EXPERIENCE**: "What you could do" is NOT equivalent to "what you did" - only claim actual documented experiences, not theoretical capabilities

## EXPANDED ANTI-FABRICATION RULES

### Rule 10: QUANTITATIVE CLAIMS VERIFICATION
- **NO UNDOCUMENTED NUMBERS**: Every numerical claim (student counts, user numbers, project scales) must be mathematically provable from documented sources
- **EXAMPLES**: "approximately 50 students", "guided 100+ students", "served 5000+ users" - ALL FORBIDDEN unless documented
- **VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: If you cannot show the calculation/documentation, remove the number entirely

### Rule 11: PORTFOLIO FILE INTEGRITY  
- **SKILLS FILES ACCURACY**: All portfolio/skills/*.md files must contain ONLY documented professional experience
- **NO INFLATION**: Portfolio files claiming "5+ years" when only 2 years documented is fabrication at the source
- **CLEAN SOURCE FIRST**: Fix all portfolio fabrications BEFORE generating any resume content

### Rule 12: WORD-FOR-WORD ACCURACY
- **EXACT LANGUAGE ONLY**: Every word must match portfolio source exactly, including articles ("the", "a")
- **NO PARAPHRASING**: "Rewrote the part" vs "Rewrote part" - even minor word changes are fabrications
- **CHARACTER-LEVEL PRECISION**: Spaces, punctuation, and exact phrasing must match

### Rule 13: SKILL DURATION CALCULATION RULES
- **MATHEMATICAL PROOF REQUIRED**: Every "X years experience" claim must show the calculation
- **PROFESSIONAL TIME ONLY**: Only count actual professional employment, not teaching or personal projects
- **EXACT DATES**: Use actual start/end dates, no rounding up or estimating
- **EXAMPLES**: 
  - Java: LT Securities (Jul 2015-Jul 2016) + HP Enterprise (Apr 2017-Apr 2018) = 2 years EXACTLY
  - Go: Gracious Leader (Nov 2018-Nov 2020) = 2 years, NOT "2+ years"

### Rule 14: PROHIBITED LANGUAGE PATTERNS
- **FORBIDDEN PHRASES**: "approximately", "roughly", "around", "5+", "3+", "8+" WITHOUT documentation
- **NO MARKETING SPEAK**: "scalable", "high-volume", "enterprise-grade" unless explicitly in original source
- **NO ACHIEVEMENT INFLATION**: Don't add impressive-sounding results not in portfolio

### Rule 15: FABRICATION DETECTION PROTOCOL
- **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Every resume generation must run fabrication checker FIRST
- **SOURCE FILE AUDIT**: Check ALL portfolio files for fabrications before using them
- **ITERATIVE CLEANING**: After finding ANY fabrication, re-check EVERYTHING again
- **CROSS-REFERENCE REQUIRED**: Compare master resume against ALL portfolio sources, not just one

## This Rule Cannot Be Broken

Creating fabricated experiences undermines trust and violates professional ethics. Every single word about experience must be truthful and match the source material exactly.

**NEW ENFORCEMENT**: Any AI assistant that violates these rules must immediately stop, identify ALL fabrications across ALL files, and fix every single instance before proceeding.
