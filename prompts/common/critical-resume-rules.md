# CRITICAL RESUME RULES - READ BEFORE ANY EDITING

## STOP AND READ THIS FIRST

Before making ANY changes to resume content, you MUST follow these mandatory checks:

### 1. FABRICATION CHECK - MANDATORY VERIFICATION

**BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING:**
1. Read the EXACT original text from master-application/master.md
2. Compare WORD-FOR-WORD with what you plan to write
3. Ask: "Am I adding ANY words, technologies, or experiences not in the original?"
4. Ask: "Am I making anything sound more impressive than it actually was?"

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:**
- ❌ Adding technologies not explicitly mentioned (Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, etc.)
- ❌ Changing experience duration (2 years cannot become "3+" years)
- ❌ Adding enterprise buzzwords like "scalable," "high-volume," "microservices"
- ❌ Enhancing job titles or responsibilities beyond original text
- ❌ Assuming frameworks were used if not explicitly stated

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
- ✅ Copy EXACT language from master application
- ✅ Use EXACT technologies mentioned in original experience
- ✅ Calculate experience years MATHEMATICALLY from documented dates only
- ✅ Verify every claim against source material

### 2. FORMATTING CHECK - MANDATORY REVIEW

**BEFORE FINALIZING:**
1. Search for duplicate headers (e.g., "## Skills" appearing twice)
2. Check for missing line breaks between sections
3. Verify consistent formatting patterns
4. Ensure proper markdown syntax

**COMMON FORMATTING ERRORS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ Duplicate section headers
- ❌ Missing blank lines between sections
- ❌ Inconsistent bullet point formatting
- ❌ Broken markdown syntax

### 3. FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before considering the resume complete:

**Content Verification:**
- [ ] Every experience matches master application EXACTLY
- [ ] All technology claims are documented in original source
- [ ] Experience years are mathematically accurate
- [ ] No fabricated enhancements or buzzwords added

**Format Verification:**
- [ ] No duplicate headers
- [ ] Consistent section spacing
- [ ] Proper markdown formatting
- [ ] PDF generates correctly at 2 pages

### 4. IF YOU CATCH YOURSELF FABRICATING

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. STOP writing immediately
2. Return to master-application/master.md
3. Copy the EXACT original text
4. Remove ALL enhancements you added
5. Verify against source material again

## REMEMBER: ACCURACY > IMPRESSIVENESS

It is better to have a less impressive but truthful resume than a fabricated one. The user's trust depends on factual accuracy. Every fabrication undermines credibility and violates professional ethics.

## THIS RULE CANNOT BE VIOLATED

Fabricating experiences or adding formatting errors wastes time and requires corrections. Follow these rules religiously to avoid repeated fixes.
