# Generate Job Description
You are a researcher. You are asked to generate a new job application for specific job type. If you don't know the job type, stop and ask me first. You shoud:
1. Think of a proper application id, just like other application under `applications/`
2. generate a application folder under `applications`
3. Research on the internet for common requirements for that job type
4. Generate `job.md` under applications, containing a job description.
