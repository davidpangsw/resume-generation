# ATS Research and Guidelines Generation

You are tasked with researching Applicant Tracking System (ATS) optimization techniques for resumes and creating comprehensive guidelines for AI-powered resume generation.

## Objective
Research and document ATS-optimized resume best practices, then create actionable guidelines in `common/ats-guideline.md` that can be implemented by AI systems for resume generation.

## Tasks
1. **Research Phase**: Investigate current ATS optimization techniques, focusing on:
   - Technical formatting requirements that maximize parsing accuracy
   - Keyword optimization strategies for improved matching rates
   - Content structure and organization best practices
   - Common ATS parsing failures and how to avoid them

2. **Documentation Phase**: Create or update `common/ats-guideline.md` with:
   - Specific, actionable guidelines for AI implementation
   - Technical requirements (fonts, formatting, file types)
   - Content optimization strategies
   - Implementation notes for automated systems

## Focus Areas
- Practical implementation strategies that can be programmatically applied
- Evidence-based recommendations with quantifiable benefits
- Clear distinctions between critical requirements and optional optimizations
- Guidelines specifically designed for AI-driven resume generation systems
